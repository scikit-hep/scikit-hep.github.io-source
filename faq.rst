FAQ
===

What is the exact project name?
-------------------------------
The project is called `Scikit-HEP`. Notice the upper-case "S" and "HEP".
That is distinct from the package `scikit-hep`.

How to pronounce the project name?
----------------------------------
Like "sy-kit happ"(y), forgetting about the "y" in "happy".
Of course "sci" stands for science.

How to get started contributing?
--------------------------------
You are most welcome and encouraged to get in touch via the resources
listed at :ref:`Get in touch <get_in_touch>`.
Please also refer to each package repository and browse through the
list of "issues" or files CONTRIBUTING for details on how to get involved.

Is there support for PyPy?
--------------------------
It's a nice idea. Support for `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_ could be envisaged in the near future
`but only once` the scientific stack based on `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ supports it.
This being said, certain package do support PyPy already.

Is there support for GPUs?
--------------------------
Support for GPU-oriented code is not foreseen as default but some of the packages
envisage it in the near- or medium-term future.
Please refer to the documentation of the various packages.
